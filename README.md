# Eric Schweitzer Portfolio

## Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my skills, expertise, and experience as a web developer, highlighting my proficiency in creating visually appealing and functional websites. I am passionate about using my technical and creative skills to deliver unique and effective web solutions for businesses and individuals. This portfolio reflects my journey in web development, from my early projects to my most recent work, demonstrating my growth and commitment to excellence in this field.

## Description

This website is built using a combination of modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I've utilized several popular JavaScript libraries such as Owl Carousel for responsive sliders, WOW.js for scroll-based animations, Easing for smooth animations, and Waypoints for triggering actions on scroll. These technologies work together to create a dynamic and engaging user experience. I've also written custom CSS and SCSS to style and layout the content, ensuring a visually appealing design. By leveraging these technologies, I've created a fast, responsive, and interactive website that provides a great user experience.
